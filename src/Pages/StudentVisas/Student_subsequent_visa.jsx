        It all started with your dream of studying in Australia — and this is when you decided to take the big step
        of moving forward with your education journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studying in Australia involves a few clear steps. Here’s a simple breakdown:
      </p>

      <h5 className="text_green">Step 1: Choose Your Course & University</h5>
      <p>
        First, decide on your preferred course, the state where you’d like to live, and your chosen college or university.
      </p>

      <h5 className="text_green">Step 2: Apply for Admission</h5>
      <p>
        Complete the application form for admission. The process depends on your situation, but with guidance, you
        can secure a place in one of Australia’s top universities.
      </p>

      <p>
        To study in Australia, you’ll need a <strong>Student Visa (Subclass 500)</strong>. This visa allows you to
        study and also work part-time. You can travel in and out of Australia as long as your visa is valid.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>While studying: work up to 40 hours per fortnight.</li>
        <li>During study breaks: work full-time.</li>
        <li>Your visa length depends on your course duration (usually course length + 2 months).</li>
        <li>Visas can last up to 5 years. For primary school (Grades 1–4), it may be up to 3 years.</li>
        <li>If you need more time, you can apply for another student visa.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can apply for this visa to study:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Years 1–12 in schools (including English/ELICOS courses).</li>
        <li>Certificates and diplomas in business, hospitality, trades, leadership, arts, etc.</li>
        <li>Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctoral programs in areas like IT, nursing, business, social work, and more.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can also include your family in your visa application (at the start or later).  
        Just make sure to declare all family members. If you get married or have a child after applying,  
        inform the department immediately to avoid visa refusal.
      </p>

      <h5 className="text_green">Student Visa Eligibility</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 6 years old when applying.</li>

                                    <p className='text'>  The Student Guardian Visa allows you to care for a minor (under 18 years of age) studying in Australia. With this visa, you can support more than one student at a time and remain in Australia until the date mentioned in your visa grant letter. If you wish to extend your stay, you may apply for another Student Guardian Visa.

                                        However, children under the age of six are not permitted to accompany you. Any family member over six years old must apply for a separate student visa.</p>  <h3 className='text_green'>Student Visa Eligibility Criteria</h3>

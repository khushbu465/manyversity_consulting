                                            To complete or extend your education, you must apply for a new student visa. The term
                                            <strong className="text_green"> "student  extension visa" </strong>
                                            is inaccurate because Australian visas are rarely extended. To extend your stay in Australia and finish your studies,
                                            you will need to apply for and be granted a new visa. In the migration sector, however, the term
                                            "student visa extension" is commonly used. Students in Australia frequently extend their student visas to complete
                                            their studies.
                                        </p>

                                            There might be several reasons why you are unable to complete your studies with the visa you have been granted:

                                            You don't need to be concerned about student visas, even if it's your first time applying for an extension.
                                            The rules will remain the same as when you initially applied.

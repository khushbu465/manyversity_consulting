                                    <h3 className='text_green'>  Study in Australia  with a Student Visa (Subclass 500)</h3>
                                    <p className='text'>  Every step toward success begins when you take action on your study goals. For many international students, Australia is a dream destination—it is home to 5 of the top 100 universities in the world and offers a high-quality learning environment.
                                        <br />
                                        While many Indian students choose countries like the USA, Canada, or the UK, Australia is becoming a highly preferred choice because of its globally recognized education system, multicultural environment, and post-study opportunities.
                                        <br />
                                        A Subclass 500 Student Visa allows international students to live and study in Australia for up to 5 years, depending on their enrolled program. If you are unable to complete your course within the original visa period, you can apply for a visa extension. After completing your studies, you may also be eligible for a Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) or other visa pathways.</p>

                                            Many students join courses like MBA, Masters in IT, Master of Teaching,
                                            Master of Social Work, Nursing, or other programs without first
                                            understanding how skills assessment works for their chosen occupation.
                                            Because of this, they end up wasting time and money when applying
                                            for permanent residency (PR).

                                            One common mistake students make is listening to friends instead of
                                            consulting with experts. This often creates problems with their studies
                                            or PR applications.
